# ETL Process for Constructing a Database in SQL Server

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)** process in **SQL Server**. The ETL pipeline is designed to extract data from a source, transform it into a structured format, and load it into a SQL Server database.

## ETL Process Breakdown
### 1. Extraction
- Source: Data is extracted from **CSV files**, **Excel**, or another database.
- Tools: SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), Python (pandas, pyodbc), or SQL Bulk Insert.

### 2. Transformation
- Data cleaning: Removing null values, duplicates, and incorrect formats.
- Data normalization: Structuring the data into tables with relationships.
- Data enrichment: Adding new columns or formatting for consistency.

### 3. Loading
- Load transformed data into SQL Server tables.
- Ensure indexing and constraints are properly applied.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL Server 2019/2022**
- **SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)**
- **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)** (optional for automation)
- **Python (pandas, pyodbc)** (for scripting ETL process)
